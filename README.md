# Schmiddi In The Game

My first 2D Pixel-Art RPG Game made with Unity on Mac.

In the Unity-Project, I use the PerfectPixel Camera-Script by GG EZ (from the Asset Store, It's free!).

# Requirements
* Graphics: [Rural Farm Tiles](https://pixanna.nl/products/rural-farm-tiles/)
* Game Engine: Unity

# How to use the Rural Farm Tiles

Attention! Add your Rural Farm Tiles Sprites into Assets > SchmiddiInTheGame > Images > Rural Farm Tiles!
